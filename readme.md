# KeckTeX

This is an XeLaTeX class, pair of bibliography styles, and template for writing UC-system Keck Proposals in XeLaTeX.

## Current Status

I'm using this template full time for my Keck proposals, but that doesn't make it right. I'm adding features as I need them. Some things I'm missing, but would like to add soon:

- Proper support for highlighting Keck/Lick publications.
- Support for highlighting PI/Collaborators in reference lists.
- More bibliography styles.
